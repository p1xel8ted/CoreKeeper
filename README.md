## Notes

- This uses a custom build of BepInEx from [here](https://core-keeper.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Core_Keeper/) should it need updating in the future.
- The game is also an IL2CPP game, so first start (and after any game updates) will be a little longer while it generates assemblies.

## Features

- Removes pillar boxing in the menus.
- Expands viewport width. Note you will see world spawn/de-spawning near the edges of the screen. Most likely be worse the wider the aspect ratio.
- The viewport width is adjusted automatically, but a custom width can be set.

## Installation
- Grab the latest release of CoreKeeper Ultra-wide Fix from [here.](https://github.com/p1xel8ted/CoreKeeper/releases)
